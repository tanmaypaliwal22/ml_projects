some random essay\n","9 Over 95% of my students are on free or reduced lunch.  I have a few who are homeless, but despite that, they come to school with an eagerness to learn.  My students are inquisitive eager learners who  embrace the challenge of not having great books and other resources  every day.  Many of them are not afforded the opportunity to engage with these big colorful pages of a book on a regular basis at home and they don't travel to the public library.  \\r\\nIt is my duty as a teacher to do all I can to provide each student an opportunity to succeed in every aspect of life. \\r\\nReading is Fundamental! My students will read these books over and over again while boosting their comprehension skills. These books will be used for read alouds, partner reading and for Independent reading. \\r\\nThey will engage in reading to build their \\\"Love for Reading\\\" by reading for pure enjoyment. They will be introduced to some new authors as well as some old favorites. I want my students to be ready for the 21st Century and know the pleasure of holding a good hard back book in hand. There's nothing like a good book to read!  \\r\\nMy students will soar in Reading, and more because of your consideration and generous funding contribution. This will help build stamina and prepare for 3rd grade. Thank you so much for reading our proposal!nannan\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","34 My students mainly come from extremely low-income families, and the majority of them come from homes where both parents work full time. Most of my students are at school from 7:30 am to 6:00 pm (2:30 to 6:00 pm in the after-school program), and they all receive free and reduced meals for breakfast and lunch. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI want my students to feel  as comfortable in my classroom as they do at home. Many of my students take on multiple roles both at home as well as in school. They are sometimes the caretakers of younger siblings, cooks, babysitters, academics, friends, and most of all, they are developing who they are going to become as adults.  I consider it an essential part of my job to model helping others gain knowledge in a positive manner. As a result, I have a community of students who love helping each other in and outside of the classroom. They consistently look for opportunities to support each other's learning in a kind and helpful way.I am excited to be experimenting with alternative seating in my classroom this school year. Studies have shown that giving students the option of where they sit in a classroom increases focus as well as motivation.  \\r\\n\\r\\nBy allowing students choice in the classroom, they are able to explore and create in a welcoming environment. Alternative classroom seating has been experimented with more frequently in recent years. I believe (along with many others), that every child learns differently. This does not only apply to how multiplication is memorized, or a paper is written, but applies to the space in which they are asked to work. I have had students in the past ask \\\"Can I work in the library? Can I work on the carpet?\\\" My answer was always, \\\"As long as you're learning, you can work wherever you want!\\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nWith the yoga balls and the lap-desks, I will be able to increase the options for seating in my classroom and expand its imaginable space.nannan\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","147 My students are eager to learn and make their mark on the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey come from a Title 1 school and need extra love.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy fourth grade students are in a high poverty area and still come to school every day to get their education. I am trying to make it fun and educational for them so they can get the most out of their schooling. I created a caring environment for the students to bloom! They deserve the best.\\r\\nThank you!\\r\\nI am requesting 1 Chromebook to access online interventions, differentiate instruction, and get extra practice. The Chromebook will be used to supplement ELA and math instruction. Students will play ELA and math games that are engaging and fun, as well as participate in assignments online. This in turn will help my students improve their skills. Having a Chromebook in the classroom would not only allow students to use the programs at their own pace, but would ensure more students are getting adequate time to use the programs. The online programs have been especially beneficial to my students with special needs. They are able to work at their level as well as be challenged with some different materials. This is making these students more confident in their abilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chromebook would allow my students to have daily access to computers and increase their computing skills.\\r\\nThis will change their lives for the better as they become more successful in school. Having access to technology in the classroom would help bridge the achievement gap.nannan\n"]}],"source":["print(\"printing some random essay\")\n","print(9,

This byte stream can then be \"de-serialized\" back into the original Python object.\n","\n","# The pickle module in Python is commonly used for this process. For example, you can serialize a Python dictionary or a machine learning model and save it as a .pkl file. Later, you can load this file in a different Python program or session and de-serialize it back into the same dictionary or model.\n","\n","# Serialization\n","# Serialization is the process of converting an object's state (including its structure and data) into a format that can be stored (like in a file or database) or transmitted (over a network). The primary purpose of serialization is to save the state of an object so that it can be recreated later.\n","\n","# The opposite of serialization is de-serialization, which involves converting the stored or transmitted data back into an object. In Python, this is often achieved using modules like pickle, json (for JSON data), or marshal.\n","\n","# Key Points\n","# Serialization is useful for persisting objects, especially complex ones like machine learning models or custom data structures.\n","# Pickle is specific to Python and isn't suitable for interoperability with other programming languages. For language-agnostic serialization, formats like JSON or XML are often used.\n","# Pickle files should be used carefully, especially when dealing with data from untrusted sources, as they can be used to execute arbitrary code.\n","\n","\n","\n","import pickle\n","\n","# Save the variables\n","with open('X_tr_set2.pkl', 'wb') as f:\n","    pickle.dump(X_tr_set2, f)\n","\n","with open('X_te_set2.pkl', 'wb') as f:\n","    pickle.dump(X_te_set2, f)\n","\n","with open('y_train.pkl', 'wb') as f:\n","    pickle.dump(y_train, f)\n","\n","with open('y_test.pkl', 'wb') as f:\n","    pickle.dump(y_test, f)\n"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyM7m4e9MEn+k0teRoOUEoQh","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
